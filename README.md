# Optimized SKA-ARL

- ARL-Algorithm Reference Library(https://github.com/SKA-ScienceDataProcessor/algorithm-reference-library)
is a set of algorithms developed for aperture 
synthesis imaging based on Numpy. ARLO is an optimized version of ARL by 
converting computational intensive kernels from python to c++ and applying 
further optimization.
